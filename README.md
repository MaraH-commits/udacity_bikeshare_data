created on 12.08.2019

#Description
This project is about analysis of bikeshare data in different cities in the US. I tried to make insights visible and did some analysis based on the followed questions.
1. Is there a difference in terms of trip duration by male and female customers in chicago?
2. How is the trip duration by a specific start station?
3. Is there a significant difference of the age by female and male customers in New York City?
